        <h4>Second Title</h4>
        <p>
          HORROR STORY , regular horror plot with some intense scenes , playback story and more into substance rather
          than slash kill type makes this movie unique . Haunting pass time and gives some good vibes . The trapping of
          group inside huanted hotel , escape routes trapped back into haunted room and end where she burns the object
          where bad spirit draws power , but the reason why ghost wants to create havoc is not dealt with , a psychotic
          patient turning into psychotic killing ghost , is bit weird . I really liked the plot , specially the girl
          with satin dress and stands alive till last .

          Dear habibi, thank you for this masterpiece of a recommendation!! fab movie dii. it is an oscar worthy movie,
          next in line after gangubai and rrr. This should be india's next oscar entry, this can compete with slum dog
          millionaire. It also rightly exposes mr ayan mukherjee, we can see deva deva from brahmastra is isnpired by
          the star of the movie and sole survivor, Nina. These are the true stars of Bollywood unlike nepo kids
          #wesupportyoukanganamaam. Humaari taraf se bohot badi HAAN hai, golden buzzer for this movie
          #India'strulygottalent. once again, thank you dear habibi.
